# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Role.create!([
    {name:"Admin"}, {name: "user"}])

#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Course.create!([
#     name:"plus for 5Â°", description: "its a Course about how make a plus", publication_date: Date.today
# ])
